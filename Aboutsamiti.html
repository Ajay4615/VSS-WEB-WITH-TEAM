    <b><p> It is an organization that transforms the lives of thousands of students in rural areas. The work of
        Student Aid
        Committee is seen as a center of youth transformation. The Committee is a body registered under Section 50A (3)
        of the Public Trustee Act, 1950 (No. E-219, Pune) with the Office of the Charity Commissioner and has
        jurisdiction over the whole of India. Senior Mathematician Dr. Dr. Achutrao Apte, freedom fighters Haribhau
        Phatak, Sumitratai Kerkar etc started this work in 1955. At that time, the work started by providing meals to
        five students at different homes. Next, the issue of students' accommodation was sorted out. Then facilities
        were provided for female students. Now the committee has four hostels in Pune and 747 male and female students
        are availing the facilities there. Samiti is not only Lodging and Boarding but here the concept of personality
        development along with affordable accommodation, food arrangement is given utmost importance. The concept of
        caste, religion, creed is not given support in the committee. The committee works on the three principles of
        cleanliness, equality and labor dignity. Although the donors are from urban areas, admission is given only to
        needy and promising students from rural. </p></b>
