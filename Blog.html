    dear friends,

    Student Aid Committee has a unique importance in our life. Through activities like yoga,
     'earn and learn' etc. we all got a new perspective on our stay here. Due to increasing 
     inflation day by day the cost of students has also increased, so you can help the committee 
     by taking responsibility of students through parent story.
        Past students regularly gather on the last Sunday of February every year for the 
    Mali Vidyarthi Mela. The year 2015-1-16 was the 00th anniversary of the 'Committee'. 
    I kindly request you to please spare some time to visit our parent organization and help.
    Tukaram Gaikwad
     Trustee Manager</p>
